# Color Match Puzzle

An interactive color matching game that uses linear algebra concepts to compare colors.

## Project Description

This project lets users match a randomly generated target color by adjusting RGB or HSV sliders.  
Color values are treated as vectors, and similarity is calculated using Euclidean distance.

The goal is to show how math concepts from linear algebra apply to visual design and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

No external libraries required.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder:
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - script.js
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## How It Works

- A random target color is generated on load
- Users adjust RGB or HSV sliders to match the color
- Clicking **Check Match** calculates similarity
- A match is successful at 80% or higher
- Users can generate a new color and try again

## Math Concepts Used

- RGB color vectors
- Euclidean distance
- Vector normalization
- RGB ↔ HSV color space conversion

## Course Context

This project was created for an Interactive Multimedia & Design course and demonstrates how linear algebra can be applied to visual systems and user interaction.
